When our mood changes, there is usually a **situation** that set off, provoked, or triggered the change in our mood.

A lot of times, the thing that happened was *external* to you. For example, somebody said something to or you saw something happen. 

Sometimes, the thing that happened was *internal* to you. For example, you may have a **thought** that may be getting you down, making you anxious, angry, or stressed. Another *internal* thing that can lead to changes in mood are sensations in your body. For example, I once noticed that my heart was beating very fast and started getting anxious because I thought that something was seriously wrong with my body. 

To identify the situation that contributed to your changed mood, it is helpful to ask yourself questions like"

- **Who** were you with?
- **What** were you doing?
- **When** was it?
- **Where** were you?
- **How** was your body feeling?
