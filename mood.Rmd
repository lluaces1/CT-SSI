# What are the emotions

According to some scientists, emotions can be grouped roughly in 6 categories. They are:

- sadness
- fear
- anger
- disgust
- surprise
- joy

You may recognize these from the movie Inside Out. The reason for that is that Pixar consulted with emotion researchers to base the movie on science. (Surprise isn't included because there were already too many characters. You can read about the science behind Inside Out and why surprise was removed here)

# My emotional life is more complex than 6 emotions

don't happen one at a time. You can find combinations of them. For example, when we remember someone who we loved who passed away we may feel melancholic

For example, this Vox article drew the possible emotional combination
